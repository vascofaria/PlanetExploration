1 **Introduction** 

An imaginary space team found a **new planet with many new resources to discover**. This team decided to set up a base camp on this planet and send **intelligent rovers to explore and gather the resources** (the places of the resources is not known in advance). The base camp has an arbitrary number of **rovers of two kinds, scouts** (small and very quick rovers that scout the planet and find resources) and **collectors** (large and slow rovers that collect resources). There are also **multiple kinds of resources,** Figure 1 - unexplored planet

**small, medium and large**. A collector can only carry a

certain amount of resources, depending on its kind, so the We decided to use an actual sphere instead of a plane, for main problem that arises is how can we speed up the example, as it brings complexity to the problem and makes process of collecting resources. The agents have to the end result a lot more interesting to watch.

The environment is **inaccessible** since the rovers only have The main objective of the project is to develop a multi-agent information about the part of the environment they saw, and system where agents have to cooperate to collect all the that information isn’t always accurate. The environment is planet samples as fast as possible. **non-deterministic** because the rovers, while moving, have

a low chance of breaking down. The environment is

**dynamic** because the rovers are deliberating while rovers

are changing the environment by moving resources. The

environment is **discrete** because the rovers have a finite

number of actuators and sensors (described later in this

section). And the environment is **non-episodic** because it

cannot be separated into independant intervals, the

resources collected will always have an influence on the

future of the scenario.

The resources can be divided into three kinds:

- Small resources (figure 2)
- Collector rovers can carry up to three ![](imgs/Aspose.Words.314a6651-5978-4e6a-8cd8-d62d66da1a1d.002.png)

The goal of the scout rover is to quickly travel across the planet and using his sensors find resources and broken Figure 4 - large resource rovers. Then it should inform the collectors of the resource’s position or broken rover’s position. To fulfill these

necessities we decided to give it the following sensors and

5 **Comparative Analysis** 

Figure 7 - Collected resources over time in S1

We defined a scenario as a set of parameters: the number ![](imgs/Aspose.Words.314a6651-5978-4e6a-8cd8-d62d66da1a1d.018.jpeg)of scouts, collectors; the radius of the planet; the number of each kind of resource. We created **3 different scenarios** (S1, S2, S3) that we will be using for comparison: 

**S1 - Few rovers and resources** 

- 20 small resources 
- 10 medium resources 
- 5 large resources 
- 4 scout rovers 
- 3 collector rovers 
- Planet radius of 60 units 

**S2 - Some rovers and resources** 

- 40 small resources Figure 8 - Collected resources over time in S1

graphs in the next pages are all calculated as an average

from these 20 runs. ![](imgs/Aspose.Words.314a6651-5978-4e6a-8cd8-d62d66da1a1d.019.jpeg)

We started by comparing the collected resources over time. To calculate this graph we ran the application 20 times and for each timestamp (0s, 0.5s, 1.0s etc…) we calculated the average number of collected resources. From figures 7,8 it’s easy to understand that the reactive rovers grab resources gradually and at a constant pace while on the hybrid architecture there are moments where the rovers collect resources really fast. This is especially noticeable with the small resources because with the hybrid architectures the collectors create a plan to grab multiple

small resources. Figure 9 - Useless Trips in S1

Regarding the total fuel spent, surprisingly the average total fuel spend is actually not that much different. We were expecting to have a lot more expended fuel in the hybrid

Finally we compared the average elapsed time that the also noticeable that as the scenario becomes more complex

the difference between the total fuel spent between the rovers take to collect all resources. In all three scenarios the types of agents becomes increasingly higher. hybrid agents outperformed the reactive agents. The most interesting result is that it seems that the larger the planet,

the more rovers and the more resources we add to the scenario![](imgs/Aspose.Words.314a6651-5978-4e6a-8cd8-d62d66da1a1d.024.jpeg) the more the hybrid agents outperform the reactive agents. This occurs because of the proactiveness that emerges from the hybrid architecture where the collectors now continue to gather resources one after another while their map belief has available resources, contrary to what happened in the reactive architecture where the collectors would be constantly waiting to react to the resource’s position that the scout rovers would bring. Also the hybrid architecture diminishes the time wasted by useless trips since the collector is able to come up with a new plan on the spot instead of going back to base, this ends up compensating for the fact that the hybrid architecture has

more useless trips.

6 **Conclusions and Further Work![](imgs/Aspose.Words.314a6651-5978-4e6a-8cd8-d62d66da1a1d.025.jpeg)**

From the comparative analysis we understood that the hybrid architecture led the rovers to collect the resources faster which ultimately was our main goal. However, it led them to do a lot more useless trips and waste a lot of fuel, which in a real world scenario would be a big problem. The Hybrid architecture also showed better performance as the scenario scales but it was more CPU intensive. Regardless, both types of agents were successfully able to solve the problem in a short amount of time.

We also believe that the hybrid architecture still has some Figure 15 - Total elapsed time in S1 space for improvements that we could not accomplish due

to our time constraints.

The most significant one is that, unlike our project proposal, the![](imgs/Aspose.Words.314a6651-5978-4e6a-8cd8-d62d66da1a1d.026.jpeg) hybrid agents don’t have open-minded commitment. This would make more sense since one of the biggest time wasters for hybrid rovers is that sometimes more than one collector goes to the same POI. If we had time to implement open-mindedness the rovers would realise through their map that a rover is already assigned,and through a comparison of utility values they could decide which one would go and which one would come up with a new plan.

Another possible minor improvement on the hybrid decision making would be to make collectors that made a useless trip decide the next plan taking proximity into account. Figure 16 - Total elapsed time in S2 Although this approach based on proximity would give worse results when done all the time because most scouts

would go to the same POI, when done only after a useless trip![](imgs/Aspose.Words.314a6651-5978-4e6a-8cd8-d62d66da1a1d.027.jpeg) (when the scouts usually are far away from the others) it

would probably save time.
